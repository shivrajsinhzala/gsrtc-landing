    lede: 'Every GSRTC bus carries a plate like <code>GJ-18-ZT-1028</code>. Here is what each part means, and why getting it exactly right matters when you search.',
    body: `
  <h2 class="reveal">Reading the plate</h2>
  <p class="reveal">Gujarat ST buses use the standard Indian vehicle registration format: <code>GJ</code> for the state, a two-digit RTO (registration) code, a letter series, and a four-digit number — for example <code>GJ-18-ZT-1028</code>. The RTO code identifies where the vehicle was first registered, not the route it runs — a Rajkot-registered bus (<code>GJ-3</code>) can run anywhere in the state.</p>
  <p class="reveal">You'll usually find the plate painted on the front bumper and above the windscreen, and again on a metal plate at the rear.</p>

  <h2 class="reveal">Why the exact plate matters for tracking</h2>
  <p class="reveal">Live tracking looks the bus up by that exact registration, so a wrong digit returns nothing rather than the wrong bus. ST Tracker corrects common punctuation differences — spaces instead of dashes, lowercase letters — automatically, but a mistyped digit or letter still won't match.</p>
  <p class="reveal">Don't have the plate, or not sure you read it right? Search by the two stations you're travelling between instead — see <a href="gsrtc-bus-timetable.html">the timetable guide</a> — and pick the right departure from the list rather than typing a plate at all.</p>`,
    faq: [
      { q: 'What does GJ-18 mean on a GSRTC bus?', a: 'GJ is the Gujarat state code, and 18 is the RTO (registration) code for where the bus was first registered (e.g. Gandhinagar / Ahmedabad region). It does not indicate which route the bus currently runs.' },
      { q: 'Can I track a bus with only part of the plate?', a: 'No — tracking needs the full registration to match the operator’s records. If you only caught part of it, search by route instead and pick the bus from the departure list.' },
      { q: 'Does it matter if I type the plate with or without dashes?', a: 'No. ST Tracker normalises spacing and dashes automatically before searching, so GJ18ZT1028 and GJ-18-ZT-1028 both work.' },

    lede: 'GSRTC runs one of the largest state road transport fleets in India. Here is what that scale actually means for tracking any single bus in it.',
    body: `
  <h2 class="reveal">The numbers</h2>
  <p class="reveal">GSRTC's published fleet runs to <b>8,554 buses</b> across Gujarat's divisions and depots, serving <b>19,026 stations</b> — from major city terminals down to single-stop villages. That scale is why a plate-based search matters: no list of "today's departures" could stay usable at that size, but a single plate resolves to one bus immediately.</p>

  <h2 class="reveal">Fleet size vs. what's trackable right now</h2>
  <p class="reveal">Not all 8,554 buses are running at any given moment. Live tracking only works for a bus that is actually on a scheduled trip — buses at the depot, between shifts, or already parked for the night report no position, which is expected behaviour rather than a gap in coverage. At any moment, the trackable fleet is however many buses are actually out on the road.</p>

  <h2 class="reveal">Divisions and depots</h2>
  <p class="reveal">The fleet is organised into divisions, each covering a region of the state and made up of several depots — the base a given bus and its crew are assigned to. A bus's RTO code (see <a href="gsrtc-bus-number-plate-format.html">the plate format guide</a>) hints at where it was registered, which is often but not always its home depot.</p>`,

  <h2 class="reveal">How it works</h2>
  <p class="reveal">The Nearby screen uses your device's location — only once you allow it — to show ST bus stations around you on a map, closest first, with the walking distance to each. There's nothing to type and no station name to guess at.</p>
  <p class="reveal">It's built for the moment a timetable search isn't the right tool: you're already somewhere, and the question is simply "which stand is closest to me right now."</p>

  <h2 class="reveal">Without allowing location access</h2>
  <p class="reveal">Location access is asked for, never assumed — the app explains why before the browser's own permission prompt appears, because a single accidental "Deny" turns location off for the site permanently. If you'd rather not share it, search by station name instead from the home screen and browse the full list of 19,026 covered stations.</p>

  <h2 class="reveal">Once you've found your stop</h2>

    h1: 'Is my GSRTC bus running late?',
    lede: 'A live position on its own does not say "on time" or "late" — it has to be checked against the timetable. Here is how that works, and when the app deliberately says nothing.',
    body: `
  <h2 class="reveal">How delay is worked out</h2>
  <p class="reveal">Once a bus's live position is known, ST Tracker compares where it actually is against where the timetable says it should be by now, along its own route. The result is shown as a plain delay — "running about 8 minutes late" — rather than a raw coordinate you'd have to interpret yourself.</p>

  <h2 class="reveal">Why it sometimes shows nothing</h2>
  <p class="reveal">The app stays silent rather than guessing when the data can't support a confident number — a bus that's been stationary a long time, or an apparent delay bigger than a real bus would ever run, is treated as a sign the estimate itself is unreliable, not as a real two-hour delay. A blank field is meant to be more useful than a wrong one.</p>

  <h2 class="reveal">Typical delay, from real arrivals</h2>
  <p class="reveal">On routes the app watches closely, it also builds a picture of how a specific service usually runs — from real recorded arrival times, not the schedule — so a rider can see "usually around 8 minutes late" for a service they take often, once enough days of data exist.</p>`,
    faq: [
      { q: 'How does the app know if a bus is late?', a: 'It compares the bus’s live GPS position against the timetable for its own route, and reports the difference as a plain delay.' },
      { q: 'Why does the delay sometimes not show at all?', a: 'When the data can’t support a confident estimate — an unusually long stop, or an implausibly large gap — the app stays silent rather than showing a number it can’t back up.' },

  <h2 class="reveal">Two separate things get reported</h2>
  <p class="reveal">Crowd reports cover two different questions, kept apart deliberately: how full the bus is (seats free, standing room, packed), and its service status (cancelled, replaced by a different bus, or simply never showed up). A cancelled bus doesn't have an occupancy — mixing the two would make neither answer trustworthy.</p>

  <h2 class="reveal">Where you see it</h2>
  <p class="reveal">On the departures list for a route, each upcoming service shows what riders have reported, before you pick one to wait for. It's most useful exactly there — deciding between two buses fifteen minutes apart is a different decision when one is reported standing-room-only and the other has seats.</p>

  <h2 class="reveal">Reporting one yourself</h2>

  <h2 class="reveal">Comparison of major GSRTC bus categories</h2>
  <ul class="reveal">
    <li><b>Local / Ordinary (Silver &amp; Blue):</b> 3x2 standard seating. Halts at all intermediate rural stops and villages. Best for economical short-distance commutes under 50 km.</li>
    <li><b>Express (Green &amp; Cream):</b> 3x2 standard seating. Stops only at major taluka bus stands and district junctions. Fast, economical transit between neighboring cities.</li>
    <li><b>Gurjarnagri (Saffron &amp; White):</b> 2x2 wide cushioned pushback seats with ample legroom. The premier express backbone of Gujarat connecting district headquarters with minimal halts.</li>
    <li><b>Non-AC Sleeper (2x1):</b> Upper and lower sleeping berths for overnight journeys connecting Saurashtra, Kutch, and South Gujarat.</li>
    <li><b>AC Sleeper &amp; Volvo / Scania:</b> Air-conditioned executive coaches featuring smooth air suspension, reading lights, charging ports, and quiet cabins for long-distance highway travel.</li>
    <li><b>Metro Link / Electric e-Bus:</b> Rapid city-to-city air-conditioned shuttles designed for point-to-point urban corridors.</li>
